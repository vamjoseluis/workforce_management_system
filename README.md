Business Requirement: Workforce Management System
Requirement:
You have been tasked with designing a system to manage the employees of a company. The system should be flexible, maintainable, and scalable to accommodate future growth and changes in business requirements. The initial features required by the system include:

## Employee Management:

* The system should support multiple types of employees, such as Managers and Developers.
* Each employee type may have specific attributes and methods relevant to their role.

## Salary Calculation:

*The system must be able to calculate the salary for different types of employees.
*Managers receive a fixed bonus in addition to their base salary.
*Developers receive a project-based bonus in addition to their base salary.

## Reporting:

* The system should be able to generate reports that include the details of each employee, including their name and calculated salary.

## Guidelines:
* The system should be designed with best practices in mind to ensure it is easy to maintain and extend.
* Consider the need for potential future expansion, such as adding new types of employees or changing the salary calculation logic.
* Ensure that the system is modular, so different parts can be updated or replaced without affecting the entire system.

Example Output:
When running the system, the output should include the details of the employees, such as:

```
Name: Alice, Salary: 8000.0
Name: Bob, Salary: 7000.0
```

## Instructions:
* Design and implement the system in Java.
* Ensure that the system is flexible and follows best practices for object-oriented design.
* Test the system with a few employee instances and print their details using the reporting mechanism.
